### MATLAB

Install MATLAB â€” to get around the permissions for /usr/local/, do 

```bash
xhost +SI:localhost:root
sudo ./install
```

- Issue: Matlab starts with OpenGL but there is shit missing on Ubuntu.

### Git

You should be using SSH not HTTPS. Anyways, to store your credentials first do 

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

and then enter your name and the personal access token.

### Docker

Install Docker via the CLI, you may need to update permissions

```bash
chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
```
